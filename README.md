# Interactive Calculator with Dark Mode and Light Mode üßÆüåô‚òÄÔ∏è

Hello everyone! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üåç

I'm thrilled to share with you my first project at Assembler Institute of Technology - an achievement that fills me with pride. I've created an interactive calculator with Dark Mode and Light Mode functionalities, along with a calculation history.

## Project Overview

This project has been an incredible journey that has allowed me to enhance my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've also had the valuable opportunity to dive deep into the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), handle user interactions, and refine my error debugging skills.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Experience a user-friendly calculator interface that makes math operations a breeze.

- **Dark Mode and Light Mode:** Switch effortlessly between Dark Mode and Light Mode to tailor it to your preferences and reduce eye strain during different times of the day.

- **Calculation History:** Keep track of your previous calculations with the calculation history feature, allowing you to review and reference your past work.

## Lessons Learned

This project has not only expanded my technical skill set but has also taught me the importance of organization, efficient planning, and making informed decisions in software development. Each hurdle I overcame became an opportunity for learning and growth as a developer.

## Getting Started

To try out the calculator, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ivanlomoro/JS_Calculator.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

3. Explore the interactive calculator, toggle between Dark Mode and Light Mode, and enjoy the calculation history.
